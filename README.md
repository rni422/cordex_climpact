# cordex_climpact
Pre-processing steps needed to run Climpact on CORDEX-Australasia data and edits made to scripts from https://github.com/coecms/cordex-climpact

NOTE: The climpact_updated folder contains only a subset of the scripts that were used to calculate the Climpact Indices for the CORDEX-Australasia (CMIP5 generation) ensemble. These scripts were updated to address errors that we encountered when running the software. 
Users are advised to follow the instructions and download the full software located at: https://github.com/coecms/cordex-climpact
Users may not encounter the same errors that we did, so these updated scripts may not be of use to them.
